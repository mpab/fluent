# fluent

...a simple, intuitive programming language

### Variables:

Integer, floating point and string variables can be used.
Valid names start with a letter or underscore '_'.

### Arithmetic operations:

'+' '/' '-' '+' '^' operations are supported with numeric types.
Some operations are also valid with string types.

### Logic operations:

'>' '>=' '<' '<=' '==' '!=' operations are supported with numeric types.

See the samples folder.

### Build:

On Linux & OS X use the ./build script.
Windows is not yet tested (and the coloured logging will probably not work).

#### Build prerequisites:

C++11...

The build script writes the output executables to ~/bin/fluent and ~/bin/dfluent - so you can comment this out or add these folders.
